Sheng Tian's IDL library II, a messier one than slib. Routines that are stable enough should be moved to slib.

The structure of the library: 
(1) root directory: assume the absolute path to this README file is '/abs/path/of/slib/README', then the root directory is '/abs/path/of/slib/'.
(2) under the root directory, files (in relative path refering to root directory) are:
	(a) idl_path: contain the subdirectories or other directories you want to add. Each line contains one directory entry, which can be:
		(i) paths relative to the root directory, /abs/path/of/slib/cdf/ will be */cdf/;
		(ii) paths relative to the home directory, /home/dir/to/thisdir/ will be ~/thisdir/;
		(iii) absolute paths, e.g., /abs/path/to/directory.
	(b) start_up.pro: start up file which reads the paths in idl_path, then merge these paths to <IDL_DEFAULT>, and set !path in idl.
	(c) README: hey, just read me :)
(3) under the root directory, folders can be added.
